In trying to get the initial setup, we tried

Setting gas fraction to 10% - forms a bar, but SFR too low when bar has correct patterns peed

Tried turning off SF and cooling until ~ 500 Myr before bar is at correct patter speed - destroys bar at transition

Same as above but replacing the gas disk with the initial gas disk

Same as above but fixing the gas disk - same problem

Accreting gas onto gas cells at the outer edge of the disk - just builds up outer disk (and suppresses bar)

Next: putting in a corona??
