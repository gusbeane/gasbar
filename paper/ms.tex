% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
Long-term, secular processes can be important drivers of present-day galactic
properties. The Milky Way is known to host one and perhaps multiple bars whose
gravitational influence has observable consequences on both stellar and
gaseous components. It has long been known that along the major axis of a bar
gas can be driven towards the galactic center, fueling, e.g., the Central
Molecular Zone and nuclear activity. On the other hand, stars are known to
congregate near Lagrange points (i.e., minimums in the galactic potential),
forming known moving groups such as Hercules. We report the results of
isolated simulations incorporating both a state-of-the-art star formation and
feedback model (in which a multi-phase interstellar medium is generated
self-consistently) and a model of the Milky Way which forms a strong bar with
a pattern speed matched to current observations. We are able to show, for the
first time, that an enhancement of star formation may occur at the Lagrange
points. We derive a collisional analogue of the theory of dynamical resonances

\section{Introduction}
Roughly two-thirds of spiral galaxies are known to host bars in the
near-infrared, about half of which are strong
\citep[e.g.][]{2000AJ....119..536E}. 

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Numerical Methods and Physical Model}
We perform our simulations using the moving-mesh code \arepo{}. Gravity is
solved using a standard oct-tree algorithm \citep{1986Natur.324..446B}.
Hydrodynamics is modelled with a finite volume solver over an unstructured
Voronoi mesh allowed to move in a quasi-Lagrangian fashion
\citep{2010MNRAS.401..791S, 2016MNRAS.455.1134P}. A concise summary of this
core functionality of \arepo{} is available with its public
release\footnote{\url{https://arepo-code.org}} \citep{2019arXiv190904667W}.

In our simulations we will reach $\sim10^3\,\Msun$ mass resolution. As a
result, the cold phase of the interstellar medium (ISM) is well-resolved
(\textcolor{red}{cite}), and an appropriate physical model which account for
the processes occuring at these scales must be used. In this vein, we use the
state-of-the-art model \smuggle{} \citep{2019MNRAS.489.4233M}. A detailed
description of the model is presented in \citet{2019MNRAS.489.4233M}, but we
summarize the salient components here.

Standard cooling processes are accounted for using tabulated \textsc{cloudy}
calculations, described in detail in \citet{2013MNRAS.436.3031V}. In addition
to standard channels, metal line, fine-structure, and molecular cooling
processes are also accounted for, allowing the gas to reach
$\sim10\,\text{K}$, as well as self-shielding for high-density gas. Cosmic ray
and photoelectric heating are also taken into account. Star formation follows
a standard probabilistic approach \citep{2003MNRAS.339..289S}, with the star
formation efficiency ($\epsilon$) set to $0.01$ and additional density and
viriality conditions. Finally, stellar feedback is accounted for in three
different channels: supernovae, young massive stellar radiation, and stellar
winds from OB and AGB stars.

The model used here is similar to the one used first by
\citet{2011MNRAS.410.1391A, 2013ApJ...770...25A} and by the Feedback In
Realistic Environments (FIRE) collaboration \citep{2011MNRAS.417..950H,
2014MNRAS.445..581H, 2018MNRAS.480..800H}, with some key differences discussed
in \citet{2019MNRAS.489.4233M}. One drawback of the \smuggle{} method is that
radiation is not self-consistently tracked and evolved, and therefore
radiation feedback must be implemented in an approximate manner. An extension
of \smuggle{} which explicitly tracks the radiation field as an additional
fluid component \citep{2019arXiv191014041K} based upon \areport{}
\citep{2019MNRAS.485..117K} is available. We plan to use this module in the
future.

\subsection{Initial Conditions}
The starting point for the construction of our initial conditions is the
N-body model GALAKOS \citep{2020ApJ...890..117D}. GALAKOS has structural
parameters and a circular velocity curve which are in reasonable agreement
with current data. However, GALAKOS is a particularly good starting point
because as \citet{2020ApJ...890..117D} showed, the disk forms a strong bar
after ~ 1 Gyr. The bar then grows, until at ~ 2.5 Gyr it has grown and slowed
down to a pattern speed of ~40 km/s/kpc. Evidence is mounting that the Milky
Way's bar is long and slow, just like that in GALAKOS.

We convert a fraction (10\%) of the initial stellar disk of GALAKOS to a gas
disk. As described in \citet{2005MNRAS.361..776S}, the gas disk is initially
in hydrostatic equilibrium. We assumed an ideal EOS for the gas phase,
consistent with our underlying physical model. We make two further
modifications to this setup. First, we ``core'' the gas profile -- instead of
assuming the gas surface density profile is exponential, we assume it is a
constant value within some radius $R_{\text{core}}$. Specifically,
\beq
\Sigma_{\text{gas}} = \Sigma_{0,\text{gas}} \times \begin{cases} 
      e^{-R_{\text{core}}/H} & R \leq R_{\text{core}} \\
      e^{-R/H} & R > R_{\text{core}}\text{,}
   \end{cases}
\eeq
where $H$ is the scale length of the disk and $\Sigma_{0,\text{gas}} =
\frac{M_{\text{gas}}}{2\pi H^2}$ is the central surface density. When
$R_{\text{core}}/H=1$ and $1.4$, $\sim10\%$ and $\sim20\%$ of the gas disk
mass is removed, respectively. This mass is not returned to another component
and is thus removed from the initial conditions entirely. However, since our
assumed gas fraction is $10\%$, this only represents a total reduction in the
disk mass by a few percent. The surface density profile of the stellar disk is
unchanged, though its velocity distribution is suitably altered.

The second modification we make is to treat the initial disk particles as star
particles. In, e.g., \citet{2019MNRAS.489.4233M} the initial disk is assumed
to be a purely collisionless component with no feedback contributions.
Instead, we assume the initial disk particles are star particles so they may
contribute gas through AGB channels. This requires assigning an age and
metallicity to each star particle. We randomly draw the age and metallicity of
each star according to the age-metallicity-radius relation of
\citet{2018ApJ...865...96F}. This ignores vertical variations which is
implemented in other models \citep[e.g.][]{2020arXiv200503646S}.

Our goal is now to construct an initial disk galaxy with gas that, like
GALAKOS, forms a strong bar. The underlying method GALAKOS uses (namely
MakeNewDisk) can already convert a fraction of the initial stellar disk to a
gas disk which is initially in hydrostatic equilibrium. However, if this setup
is naive


% Standard cooling processes from hydrogen and helium undergoing two-body

\section{Two-component Toomre instability criterion}
The Toomre instability criterion for a two-component fluid was first derived
by \citet{1984ApJ...276..114J}. For a mode of wavenumber $k=2\pi/\lambda$ to
be stable against gravitational collapse, the criterion for the two fluids in
an infinitesimally thin disk is that,
\beq
Q_2(k) = \left(Q_g^{-1}(k) + Q_s^{-1}(k) \right)^{-1} > 1\text{,}
\eeq
where $Q_2(k)$ is the two-component Toomre parameter and,
\beq
Q_g(k) = \frac{\kappa^2 + k^2 c_s^2}{2\pi G k \Sigma_{g,0}}\text{,}
\eeq
where $\kappa$ is the radial epicyclic frequency, $c_s$ is the sound speed of
the gas, and $\Sigma_{g,0}$ is the surface density of the gas. $Q_s(k)$ can be
obtained by replacing $c_s$ by $\sigma_R$ (the radial velocity dispersion) and
$\Sigma_{g,0}$ by $\Sigma_{s,0}$ (the stellar surface density). Note that the
familiar one-component Toomre criterion can be obtained by minimizing $Q_g(k)$
as a function of $k$.

We denote the minimum of $Q_2(k)$ as a function of $k$ by $Q_2$. We consider
only physically plausible values of $k$ between $0.06$ and $6000\,\kpc^{-1}$
(corresponding to modes of wavelength $\lambda\sim100\,\kpc$ to $1\,\pc$). The
equivalent of the one-component Toomre stability criterion is that $Q_2>1$,
such that the disk is stable against collapse of modes of all wavelengths.

\section{\mwib{} resolution levels}
We set a series of standard resolution levels similar to those in the Aquarius
convention. Due to the isolated nature of our simulations, it is convenient to
tune the particle mass to a specific number.

\begin{tabular}{cccc}
resolution level & $m_{\text{DM}}$      & $m_{\text{b}}$    & $\epsilon$        \\
                 & $[\,M_{\odot}\,]$    & $[\,M_{\odot}\,]$ & $[\,\text{pc}\,]$ \\
$5$              & $2.4\times10^6$      & $4.8\times10^5$   & $80$             \\
$4$              & $3\times10^5$        & $6\times10^4$     & $40$             \\
$3$              & $3.75 \times 10^{4}$ & $7500$            & $20$             \\
